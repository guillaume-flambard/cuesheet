/**
 * CLI: the single entry point for the installed `cuesheet` command.
 *
 * This file dispatches and adds nothing. The implementations live in the CLIs
 * it calls, and it spawns them rather than importing them, because they are
 * scripts with their own arg parsing and their own exit codes. The one thing
 * this file is strict about is exit-code passthrough: a gate that refuses must
 * reach a script as exit 1, or the command is unusable as a gate.
 *
 * Machine paths appear only in the shim that installs this command, never
 * here.

  -v, --version   print the version

Every subcommand takes --help. Commands that print a report also take
--format json, because a verdict a machine cannot read is not a verdict.

A run needs a model. The default uses the local opencode binary. The terminal
also accepts --provider openrouter|openai|compatible|anthropic and --model ID. Credentials:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or optional CUESHEET_API_KEY for a compatible
endpoint selected with --base-url URL. See cuesheet surface --help.
