/**
 * Adapter: the filesystem as the event log's home.
 *
 * The store in core is pure, so somebody has to own durability, and this is
 * that somebody. One file per session, one JSON event per line, appended and
 * never rewritten. The format is append-only text rather than a database
 * because a database choice here would be a decision made before any replay
 * measurement justifies it, and because an append-only log that is trivially
 * greppable is the one you can debug at 3am with a text editor.
 *
 * The write discipline: append a line, fsync the file descriptor, and only
 * then report success. A session that claims an event it did not persist is
 * worse than one that failed, because the gap is invisible until it matters.
 *
 * Everything else in this file exists because a file on disk can be wrong in
 * ways a value in memory cannot, and because the wrong answer this store used to
 * give was a *confident* one. It reported three durable events as a lost
 * session, it reported a dead process's refusal as a lost race, and it reported
 * a full disk as a journal that had moved. Each of those is a claim about the
 * world made on behalf of a machine that had no such claim to make.
 *
 * So the rule the whole file runs on is one the rest of this repository already
 * runs on, applied to bytes:
 *
 * ```text
 * a line that cannot be read is not a line that was never there
 * a journal is attested up to the first line that stops making sense
 * nothing past that point is claimed, including its absence
 * ```
 *
 * And the second rule, which is what makes a refusal answerable:
 *
 * ```text
 * a refusal that is not a conflict must be loud and must carry a reason
 * ```
 *
 * The two write paths keep their different meanings. `appendIfCurrent` is a
 * decision: it goes stale when the journal moves, it never waits, and null means
 * exactly one thing, which is "the journal is no longer where you read it". A
 * fact is not a judgement, so `appendFact` writes whatever the revision is now.
 * What a fact does *not* get is a sequence that collides with bytes nobody can
 * read, and that refusal names itself.
 *
 * The measurements behind all of it are in `docs/store-adversary.md`, including
 * the three that found nothing.
