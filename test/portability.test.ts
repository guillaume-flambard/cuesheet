/**
 * Portability invariants.
 *
 * The separation this repository rests on is that `src/core` decides and
 * `src/adapters` look. A person on another machine can only get the value out
 * of this if that separation holds, so these tests are not a lint pass, they
 * are the contract.
 *
 * Three levels, deliberately not conflated:
 *
 *   PORTABLE    the code does not depend on Guillaume's machine
 *   INSTALLABLE someone can install it easily
 *   PUBLISHABLE we are ready to promise it works on their machine
 *
 * Only PORTABLE is claimed here. The shim is knowingly machine-local and says
 * so, and pretending otherwise would be the exact failure this file exists to
 * catch.
