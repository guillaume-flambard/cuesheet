/**
 * The producer. The thing that makes the surface able to act.
 *
 * V1 had none. `app/state.ts:125` said so, honestly:
 *
 * ```text
 * // The surface has no model yet, so it cannot promise work it has not started.
 * ```
 *
 * This module is that producer. It is the only writer of the surface's state, and
 * it does four things a component is forbidden to do:
 *
 * 1. **Resolves the scope of a sentence from the environment** (`context.ts`),
 *    so no person is asked to name a project the machine already knows.
 * 2. **Runs the real agent loop** (`src/core/loop.ts`), through injected
 *    `ModelAdapter` and `ToolRunner` interfaces so a test can drive it with
 *    fakes and no credits.
 * 3. **Translates each event once** (`translate.ts`) into the surface's own
 *    vocabulary, so the work is visible without the bookkeeping.
 * 4. **Owns the admission.** The effect request and its conditional append
 *    (`appendIfCurrent`) that `src/chat.ts:432-467` holds for the diagnostic
 *    chat are here for the same reason: the emission is not the outcome, and a
 *    run that never starts must not be recorded as one that did.
 *
 * ## One store, and what a mid-run sentence does to it
 *
 * The `EventStore` is built once per producer, not once per run. That was the
 * defect SW-02 fixed and it is worth stating why it was ever wrong: a store
 * built inside `start()` gives every run a private log, so a sentence typed
 * during a run has no log it could join, and the only thing left to do with it
 * is start another run. Measured, before the fix: two runs, two logs, two
 * `effect_requested`, `frame.directives` empty on all sixteen inferences of
 * both, and the first run's request orphaned.
 *
 * So `say()` while a run is in flight appends a `directive` to that one log and
 * starts nothing. The loop recompiles its frame from the log at the top of every
 * step (`src/core/loop.ts:184-185`), so the directive reaches the next inference
 * with no change to the core. There is no queue and no pending-message field
 * anywhere in this app, and the test says so structurally rather than in a
 * comment.
 *
 * ## The safe boundary is `infer`, and it is the loop's own
 *
 * `model.infer(frame)` is called at `src/core/loop.ts:187`, after the frame has
 * been recompiled from the log and before any of the step's work exists. That is
 * the boundary, and it was read off the loop rather than invented for this
 * slice: it is the last point at which the loop is committed to acting on a
 * frame it has already read.
 *
 * The producer wraps the injected adapter, reads the revision on the way in, and
 * commits the step's record on the way out through `appendIfCurrent`. A sentence
 * typed during the inference moved the log, so the commit is refused, the worker
 * re-reads and re-derives, and the outcome is reported as `rebased` with the
 * revision it left and the revision it landed on. Nothing is killed mid-write:
 * the loop finishes its current step, because that step's appends are already
 * durable and the log is append-only (`src/core/store.ts:159-163`).
 *
 * ## Why the loop's own stop reason decides what the surface says
 *
 * `runAgentLoop` returns `goal-closed`, `budget-exhausted` or `blocked`, and it
 * never ends because a model claimed to be done (`src/core/loop.ts:8-22`). The
 * surface reports that stop reason through `entryForStop` and invents nothing.
 * That is the differentiator the brief names: the core is precisely what stops
 * the agent from lying about what it did, so the surface's job is to show what
 * the core established, not to smooth it.
