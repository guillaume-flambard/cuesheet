/**
 * What the surface shows, and what it can ask for.
 *
 * The rule the whole app is built on:
 *
 * > No TUI component decides anything.
 *
 * Components receive this state and emit a control. They do not read the
 * filesystem, they do not know what a project is, and they do not resolve a
 * binding. If a component needed to know any of that, it would be a place where
 * presentation and decision are mixed, which is the defect this whole project has
 * spent sixteen milestones refusing and which OBS-1, OBS-2 and OBS-3 each found
 * again in a smaller way.
 *
 * So the vocabulary here is deliberately not the core's vocabulary. The core says
 * `pendingEffect`, `revision`, `ArtifactStanding` and `CONFIRMED_COMPLETE`. This
 * says "five projects ready", "verifying", "completion unknown". The translation
 * happens once, in `producer/translate.ts`, and a component cannot reach the other
 * side.
 *
 * ## What V2 changed in this file
 *
 * The old `submit` control carried a `TurnIntent`, a five-case union decided by
 * exact string matching against hardcoded French phrase lists, and this file
 * answered it. The union is gone. `submit` carries the sentence, and only the
 * sentence:
 *
 * ```text
 * before  submit(turn: TurnIntent)  -> one of five canned replies
 * after   submit(text: string)      -> the sentence is recorded, and the producer runs
 * ```
 *
 * Two consequences, both of them the point. There is no longer a phrase that can
 * produce "name a project" or "not a goal", because there is no longer a place
 * where a phrase is classified. And `busy` is finally true when it is set: it is
 * set by the producer, at the moment it starts the real loop, which is the
 * admission this file made at line 125 in V1 and could not keep.
 *
 * VIEW-01 holds here and is asserted: this file observes nothing, imports
 * nothing, and `derive` is a pure function of its two arguments.

/**
 * The durable identity of one line.
 *
 * Opaque here. The surface only ever asks whether two of these are the same
 * string; who mints one and out of what is the producer's business and not this
 * file's.
 *
 * ## Why a line needs a name
 *
 * A reply rendered three times is not three replies. It is one reply the surface
 * could not recognise, because until now an entry was only its words, and words
 * cannot answer "have I already shown you this?". Two genuinely distinct replies
 * may read exactly the same, and one reply re-rendered must not be mistaken for
 * either of them, so identity cannot be read off the content either. It has to
 * be carried.
 *
 * So the producer says which line this is, and this file holds it. `translate.ts`
 * builds that name from the journal sequence of the event the line came from,
 * which is the one fact about a line that survives a replay, a reconnect and a
 * restart without being recomputed from anything a person can see.
